# exploratory-data-analysis-on-retail-data-with-Python

# Summary
I loaded the data into Pandas, cleaned it, and performed exploratory analysis, revealing that November 2011 had the highest sales, while December 2011 had the lowest.


# Solution
The data analysis process involved identifying the best-selling product, calculating monthly sales data, ensuring data accuracy through cleaning, and revealing that the United Kingdom was the top-performing country in sales. These insights offer valuable information to enhance online retail performance. Data-driven recommendations can be made, such as concentrating marketing efforts on the best-selling product and targeting the UK market to potentially increase sales and overall profitability.


# Approach
The project followed a structured process, starting with data loading and comprehensive cleaning, addressing missing values and outliers. Summary statistics were computed, and visualizations were created to understand sales trends. The Pandas `groupby` method was used to analyze total sales by country and individual customer expenditures, providing insights for data-driven decisions to improve retail operations.
